# Heart disease prediction using maching learning
# Description
This is a machine learning project that uses various machine learning alogorithms to predict whether a patient is suffering from heart disease or not. Here I am using variour machine learning algorithms like Random Forest classifier, XGBClassifier, GaussianNB, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression.
